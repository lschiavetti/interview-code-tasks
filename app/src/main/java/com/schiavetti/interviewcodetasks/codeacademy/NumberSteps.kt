/**
 * 1. Number steps
 * Many programming languages have built-in functions that output sequences of numbers
 * separated by steps. Create your own Kotlin function from scratch that creates a sequenced
 * list of numbers from 0 to a maximum input value and input step. For example, a maximum
 * value of 8 and a step value of 2 should return an output of [2, 4, 6, 8].
 *
 * Source: https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/kotlin-code-challenges-for-beginners/
 *
 * Even though it's not commonly used on daily tasks, the step function is interesting.
 * It allows to perform a loop with a defined pace, different from using a default loop
 * which will always take 1 as the step value, and thus perform the loop through all the
 * elements and numbers on the list.
